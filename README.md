# Chingu Voyage 3 - Team Bears #21

## Elevator Pitch
A forum for student housing and everything that accompanies this task.

## Initial Ideas

- Can send a message/arrange a house/room viewing directly.
- Rate houses/landlords/agencies through application, after having lived in their accomodation.
- Track issues within the house. For example if something in particular breaks while living there can open a ticket.
- Can track when the payments/deposits need to be made by.
- Authorised/Authenticated Users.
